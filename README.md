##  How It Works

- The user enters a city name
- The app sends a `fetch` request to the OpenWeatherMap API
- The weather data is parsed and displayed on the page
- Weather icons change based on the condition (like sunny, rainy, cloudy)

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Error message for invalid or empty input


If you get the error “city not found,” it means the city you entered may be ambiguous or not recognized. To fix this, you can add the 2-letter country code after the city name, separated by a comma.
